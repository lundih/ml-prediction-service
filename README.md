## Project Summary

The project contains a pre-trained, `sklearn` model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on [the data source site](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing). It serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling.

The project uses Docker for containerization and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for container orchestration

## Running the App

**Setting Up the Environment**

- Standalone 
    - Ensure python 3.7 is available in the host machine
    - Install venv
    - Create the virtual environment for the project
    - Activate the environment
    - Install the app's dependencies by running: 
    ```bash 
    make install
    ```

- Docker
    - Set up and configure Docker
    - (Optional) Install hadolint to lint the Dockerfile

- Kubernetes
    - Set up and configure Docker
    - Set up and configure Kubernetes (minikube and Kubectl used in this project)
    - Create a containerized Flask application

**Commands**

- Standalone: 
```bash
python app.py
```
- Run in Docker: 
```bash
./run_docker.sh
```
- Run in Kubernetes:
```bash
./run_kubernetes.sh
```
